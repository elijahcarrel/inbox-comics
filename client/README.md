TODO(ecarrel):
- Remove the dozens of `: any`s from the codebase that I used when I was trying to get things running.
- Remove CORS and add a proxy instead.
- Use CSS autoprefixer.
- Fix mini-css-extract-plugin warnings and also fix the CSS sometimes not loading correctly on various pages (can't tell if it's the same thing causing both problems?).
